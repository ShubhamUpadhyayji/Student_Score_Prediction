**Objectives**

This system aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.Through this project we can determine.

1) How many hours need to do the study to get 99% marks

2) If I will do study x() hours per day so how much marks I will get

**Through these points the school/College can determine the performance of the student.**

**--Student marks Prediction model. I created a student marks prediction model with the help of following few steps like :--*

1)Define project objectives

2)Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning , Data Preparation , split into train and test , Feature Scaling).

3)Model Selection

4)Data Collection

5)Data Visualization

6)Model Building

7)Deploy Model
