**Objectives**

This system aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.Through this project we can determine.

How many hours need to do the study to get 99% marks
If I will do study x() hours per day so how much marks I will get

**Through these points the school/College can determine the performance of the student.**

**--Student marks Prediction model. I created a student marks prediction model with the help of following few steps like :--*
